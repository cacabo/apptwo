# AppTwo

An application for applications. We make applying to jobs and organizations easier by organizing your information and allowing you to find the details that matter. Understand how far you are in each application, how much work is left, and who you've been put in contact with - all in one place.

Say goodbye to a reckless mess of Excel sheets and Word docs.
